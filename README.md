# soundcloud-liberator
Allows direct download for any track on soundcloud, regardless of whether download is available

This is a generic [WebExtension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) browser plugin that can be used to download soundcloud tracks. The usage is simple. Load the plugin in your browser, and visit a soundcloud page for a single track. Once on the page, click the FREE button in the top right, and the mp3 version of the song will be launched in a new tab in your browser. You can then press Ctl-S to save the song to your computer.

I haven't tried using this with playlists, nor do I intend to support that feature in the future, unless this gains a lot of traction. 

For firefox, WebExtensions can be loaded from source using the about:debugging page. WebExtensions are cross-compatible and should also work in Chrome.
